        <p>
            Hi! I'm Mateo from Argentina and I love make games in Unity and Godot.<br>
            I specialize in gameplay programming; mechanics, behaviors, interface.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Although my specialty is programming, I have experience in other areas of video game development such as:
        </p>
        <ul>  
            <li>3D modeling and 3D animation:</li>
            I have basic experience using Blender for 3D modeling, which allows me to quickly edit some flaws in a model that are passed to me or was acquired. I also use Cascadeur for 3D animations.
            <li>Sound effects:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reaper --> as an audio DAW</li>
                    <li>FMOD --> to implement logic in video game audio (adaptive sound)</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Feel free to contact me to discuss a career opportunity, a collaboration for a project, or anything related to creating video games or software.</p>

        <p>Check out my projects and enjoy them!</p>
